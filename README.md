In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. I was able to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.


Using CSV files, I was able to analyze the data using Pandas libraries, and plot it with matplotlib.

* Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of cancer spreading sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
